There will be 2 major classes with hierarchies.

1. The content hierarchy 
	This will contain the locational data of the text.
	- Beginning
	- Ending
	- Location in terms in line number and alphabet number

	Classes :
		FullText : Will represent the whole document.
		   |
		   -----> Sentence :  Will represent a single sentence of the document.
		   	     |
			     -----> Word :  Will represent the entire word.
	
2. The trie hierarchy
	This will contain the hierarchial data of each word.
	- Level
	- isEnding
	->> The ending alphabet node will keep a vector of address of the Words that end at that Node.
	->> Each alphabet will not have a pre-defined hash-map to get store the following alphabet to minime memory usage.

	Classes :
		Trie  : Obviously, the main tree structure.
		  |
		  -----> Alphabet : Will represent a single alphabet.

3. The Document
	This will serve as the main API to the entire system.
	- Content 
	- Trie
	The program will interact with this one object and carry out it's operations.
